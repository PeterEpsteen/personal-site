#### Striving to tackle big problems through software, I am constantly striving to better myself as an engineer by staying up to date on modern software solutions and best practices.
<br>


I am a passionate engineer with 3 years of software development experience. While I have worked professionally across the stack, I specialize in backend development. I take pride in the robust, scalable backend systems I have built, and love to tackle seemingly impossible problems. To tackle these challenges I use the best tool for the job, and thus have experience in a wide range of modern languages/environments. 

While I love tinkering with multiple different languages and domains, In my day to day I gravitate towards Golang and Javascript/Typescript (Node and React). During my career I have professionally written code in many other languages, namely Python, Java, Rust, and C++. I have always had a genuine interest in the theory and fundamentals of Computer Science, and thus am able to pick up and switch between languages efficiently and effectively. 

I deeply subscribe to the devops mindset, and am highly skilled in various technologies such as Linux, Docker, Bash, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Packer. I have experience working in all the major cloud providers, but spend most of my time in Google Cloud Products. I have developed, deployed, and maintained many successful systems using all of these platforms.
